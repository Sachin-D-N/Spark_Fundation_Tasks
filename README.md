# Task 1

Prediction using Supervised ML

- Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
- I am Using python and Sklearn for this task.
- Data can be found  [here](http://bit.ly/w-data)
- What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task 2

Prediction using Unsupervised ML For Iris dataset


### Data Set Information:
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica

- From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
- I am Using python and Sklearn for this task.
- Data can be found [here](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)
